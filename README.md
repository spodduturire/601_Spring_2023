# Data Science Fundamentals

This repository contains 8 R programming challenges and a Final Project. Various datasets were used for these challenges which were in .csv, .xlsx formats.
We first start by reading in datasets and then tidying them such that we can perform data analysis. Some of these tasks include-

1) Grouping Dataset Columns
2) Summarizing Datasets
3) Data Wrangling Methods
4) Pivoting Datasets around axes

The data is then visualized so that we can notice different patterns and trends in the data. Some of the visualization methods include -

1) Univariate, Bivariate graphs
2) Time-series Graphs
3) Part-Whole Graphs
4) Multiple Dimension Visualizations

The posts directory has the .qmd files for all the challenges. The _freeze/posts directory holds the results from executing the files in RStudio.
